## Daily Activity Monitoring - Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project we make use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

**The project was carried out as a milestone (peer-assessded) assignment  within the Coursera course ["Reproducible Research"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research/) of the [Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) in August 2019**
